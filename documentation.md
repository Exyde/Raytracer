# Notes


## Diffuse Material (or Matte)
- Don't emit light
- Take the color of surrouding, but mix it with their own instrinsic color.
- Reflect light in a randomized direction
- Might absord aswell, which leads to darker material
- We'll first create a material that randomly diffuse light equally in all direction from surface
